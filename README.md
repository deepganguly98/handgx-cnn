# Gesture Controlled Keyboard CNN

Using American Standard Sign Language (ASL) to build a hands-free keyboard using deep learning.
The technologies that we used are Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Kivy and fully developed in python and ipython notebooks.

Open CV has been extensively used to pre process the image dataset so that the deep learning models train over a small dataset but work perfectly on variety of different and new data.
